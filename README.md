# LSTM
Model for Stock Prediction

I have built two models with different datasets as my semester project.
One dataset included importing data from YahooFinance and deploying model and training on that data.

The second dataset was a CSV file that included minute-to-minute data from Bank Niftys of India. The dataset contained data from 2015 to 2024.
The first 10,000 values of the CSV file were chosen to train and test the model since the dataset was too large for the model to handle and it could lead to overfitting.
